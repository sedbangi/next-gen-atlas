FacilitatorDAOs are expected to take swift action appropriate to the category of ecosystem stakeholder, including derecognition of the AC or offboarding the Ecosystem Actor.\n This general expectation becomes a mandate if the proximity of Alignment Conservers to the instigating action renders it reasonable to expect that they should have detected the unfolding organizational drift. The assessment of reasonableness in this context does not hinge on the action/inaction (lack of attention or diligence) of an individual Alignment Conserver. Instead, the inquiry is based on a reasonable-person standard, and applied to the customary professional expectations associated with the Alignment Conserver position.

Because their opinions/actions carry greater weight than usual, the EA's instigating action has the potential to influence a broad section of the community. The Alignment Conservers have a proactive obligation to publicly defend against instigating actions of organizational drift. To support the EA's actions constitutes misalignment on the part of the ACs that likely cannot be characterized as a minor, slippery slope infraction.\n In this Scenario, the FacilitatorDAOs should likely derecognize the ACs who publicly supported the EA's proposal per A.1.4.m2-2.0.4.3.",
