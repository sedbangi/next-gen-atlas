(See also the definition of \"Incentivized Alignment\" [here](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#incentivized-alignment).)\n If effective, Incentivized Alignment may lead to an ecosystem actor behaving in ways that are outwardly indistinguishable from the behavior of an actor who is inherently Universally Aligned.\n AVCs are tasked with modifying the Scope Alignment Artifacts so that Incentivized Alignment is brought increasingly in line with Universal Alignment.\n The degree of congruence, or fit, between Incentivized Alignment and Universal Alignment is termed \"Spiritual Alignment\" in the Target Document.",

AVCs represent the interests of MKR holders and MKR holders are of course interested in the economic management and governance of NEWDAO. But the organizing and expressing of MKR holder interests is intended to be first and foremost a cultural activity that gives life to intangible social value.\nCultural structures uniquely function by the logic of freedom.
